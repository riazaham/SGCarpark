# SGCarpark
This app will allow a user to search through carparks available in the datagov carpark database.
The query will return a static map and the carpark rates.
The user can also view the location on google maps.

This is a small scale project to practice my skills in the following tech stack:
- NodeJS
- Express
- EJS
- OneMap API
- datagov carpark API
